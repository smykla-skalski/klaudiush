# Exceptions

Exceptions let Claude bypass validation blocks when there's a good reason. Each policy controls a specific error code - whether exceptions are allowed, whether a justification is required, and how many are permitted per hour or day.

All three presets include audit logging. The difference is how strict the requirements are.

See the [exceptions guide](/docs/exceptions) for the full policy syntax and audit log format.
