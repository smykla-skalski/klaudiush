# GIT012: Claude attribution in commit message

## Error

Commit message contains AI-generated attribution (e.g., "Generated by Claude" or "Co-authored-by: Claude").

## Why this matters

The commit author takes responsibility for the changes, so commits should be attributed to the human who reviewed and approved them. AI attribution in git history can also create legal and compliance complications.

## How to fix

Remove AI attribution from commit messages:

```bash
# Wrong:
git commit -sS -m "feat(api): add endpoint

Generated by Claude"

# Correct:
git commit -sS -m "feat(api): add endpoint"
```

## Configuration

Disable this check in `config.toml`:

```toml
[validators.git.commit.message]
block_ai_attribution = false
```
