# GIT009: File Does Not Exist

## Error

Attempting to stage a file with `git add` that doesn't exist.

## Why This Matters

Staging non-existent files indicates a typo in the path or that the file was deleted/moved.

## How to Fix

1. Verify the file path:

   ```bash
   ls -la path/to/file.go
   ```

2. Check for typos in the path

3. If the file was renamed, stage the new path:

   ```bash
   git add new/path/to/file.go
   ```

4. If the file was deleted, stage the deletion:

   ```bash
   git add -u  # Stages all modifications and deletions
   ```
