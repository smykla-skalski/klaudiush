# GIT009: File does not exist

## Error

You ran `git add` on a file that doesn't exist.

## Why this matters

This usually means a typo in the path, or the file was deleted or moved.

## How to fix

1. Verify the file path:

   ```bash
   ls -la path/to/file.go
   ```

2. Check for typos in the path

3. If the file was renamed, stage the new path:

   ```bash
   git add new/path/to/file.go
   ```

4. If the file was deleted, stage the deletion:

   ```bash
   git add -u  # Stages all modifications and deletions
   ```
