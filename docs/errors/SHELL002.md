# SHELL002: Command nested too deeply to inspect

## Error

The command runs another command through more layers of launchers, scripts, aliases or functions than klaudiush follows, so what it finally runs cannot be inspected.

## Why this matters

Klaudiush follows `env`, `sudo`, `nice`, `bash -c`, `eval`, script files, aliases and functions to find the command that really runs, and checks that command like any other. It stops after eight levels. A command nested deeper could hide a `git commit` or `git push` from every validator, so klaudiush blocks it instead of letting it through unchecked.

```bash
env env env env env env env env env git commit -m "message"
```

## How to fix

Run the inner command directly:

```bash
git commit -sS -m "message"
```

If a wrapper is really needed, use one layer of it:

```bash
env FOO=1 git commit -sS -m "message"
```

## Disabling

Legitimate commands almost never nest this deep. If one does, disable the check:

```bash
klaudiush disable SHELL002
```
