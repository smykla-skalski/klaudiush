# GIT019: Blocked files in git add

## Error

Attempting to stage files that match a blocked pattern (default: `tmp/*`).

## Why this matters

Temporary files, build artifacts, and scratch directories should not be committed. Staging them clutters history and can leak sensitive data or large binaries.

## How to fix

Remove the blocked files from your `git add` command:

```bash
# Instead of:
git add tmp/scratch.txt

# Add only the files you want:
git add src/main.go internal/parser.go
```

If you need to track a file in a blocked directory, update the blocked patterns in configuration.

## Configuration

```toml
[validators.git.add]
blocked_patterns = ["tmp/*", "*.secret"]
```

Disable the validator:

```toml
[validators.git.add]
enabled = false
```
