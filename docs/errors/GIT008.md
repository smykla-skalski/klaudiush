# GIT008: Missing Branch for Push

## Error

No branch specified for git push and the current branch doesn't track a remote branch.

## Why This Matters

Without an explicit branch, git may push to an unexpected location or fail with a confusing error.

## How to Fix

Specify the branch explicitly:

```bash
git push origin feature-branch
```

Or set up tracking for the current branch:

```bash
# Push and set upstream tracking:
git push -u origin feature-branch

# Future pushes on this branch:
git push
```

## Check Current Tracking

```bash
# Show branch tracking configuration:
git branch -vv
```
