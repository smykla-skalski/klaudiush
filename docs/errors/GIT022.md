# GIT022: Kong org push to origin blocked

## Error

Pushing to the `origin` remote in a Kong organization repository. Organization policy requires pushing to `upstream` instead.

## Why this matters

In fork-based workflows, `origin` points to the personal fork while `upstream` points to the organization repository. Pushing to the wrong remote can create confusion and bypass branch protection rules.

## How to fix

Push to `upstream` instead of `origin`:

```bash
# Instead of:
git push origin main

# Use:
git push upstream main
```

Check your remotes:

```bash
git remote -v
```

## Configuration

This is enforced through the push validator's blocked remotes configuration:

```toml
[validators.git.push]
blocked_remotes = ["origin"]
allowed_remote_priority = ["upstream"]
```

## Hook output

When this error is triggered, klaudiush writes JSON to stdout:
