# SEC002: Hardcoded password detected

## Error

A hardcoded password was found in the code.

## Why this matters

Anyone with repository access can see passwords stored in code. Git history preserves them even after you delete them. Hardcoded passwords also tend to get reused across systems, so one leak can compromise several services.

## Detected patterns

Patterns that trigger this error:

```text
password = "secret123"
passwd: 'mypassword'
pwd='admin123'
```

## How to fix

1. Never hardcode passwords.

2. Read them from environment variables:

   ```go
   dbPassword := os.Getenv("DB_PASSWORD")
   ```

3. Store them in configuration files excluded from git:

   ```yaml
   # .env (in .gitignore)
   DB_PASSWORD=secure_password_here
   ```

4. Inject secrets at runtime through Kubernetes Secrets, Docker secrets, or CI/CD secret variables.

## Configuration

Allow test passwords:

```toml
[validators.secrets]
allow_list = [
    "password.*test",
    "password.*example",
]
```

Disable the password pattern entirely:

```toml
[validators.secrets]
disabled_patterns = ["generic-password"]
```
