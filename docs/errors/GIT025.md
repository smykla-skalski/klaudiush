# GIT025: Push to blocked remote

## Error

The `git push` command targets a remote that is on the blocked list.

## Why this matters

Organizations may block certain remotes to enforce workflow conventions. For example, blocking `origin` in a fork-based workflow ensures developers push to the organization's repository via `upstream` instead of their personal fork.

## How to fix

Use an allowed remote instead:

```bash
# Check available remotes:
git remote -v

# Push to an allowed remote:
git push upstream main
```

## Configuration

```toml
[validators.git.push]
blocked_remotes = ["origin"]
allowed_remote_priority = ["upstream", "origin"]
```

The `allowed_remote_priority` list determines which remote to suggest when a blocked remote is used. The first available non-blocked remote from this list is suggested.

## Hook output
